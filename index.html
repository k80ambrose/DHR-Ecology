        <LI>Digital participants should favor truly sustainable practices, models, and systems as they operate in the non-digital world whenever the participants operate in the digital world.<br>
            <OL TYPE='A'>
              <LI>Infrastructure requirements of these systems often have vast negative ramifications on the climate and environment. Making sure that these physical systems digital participants use are not actively detrimental but beneficial to the environment is a right digital participants should have and uphold. <br>
              <LI>Fast fashion refers to the rapid turnover of fashion that leads to diminished levels of quality. This reduction in quality is very resource intensive as <a href='https://hbr.org/2022/01/the-myth-of-sustainable-fashion'>sustainability</a> and <a href='https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/environment/the-deception-of-greenwashing-in-fast-fashion-75557'>longevity of the materials is ignored</a>. <br>
              <LI>Many companies often falsely use the terms of sustainability to make their products appear more favorable to the environmentally conscious buyer. Greenwashing is a term used to designate this practice. <br>

        <LI>Digital objects that can be recycled and reused should be recycled and reused if a general comprehensive resource calculus determines it beneficial. <br>
        A resource calculus will have continual evolving considerations of resources, energy, labor, and many more facets of how digital objects are produced, distributed, and used to determine how useful it is to recycle and reuse a digital object. An exact measure and definition of a resource will not be elaborated fully here but will hopefully be once more people alter this document.<br>

        A resource calculus might deem recycling an unfavorable option if, for example, a material, abundant through ethical means of acquiring, uses more energy to conduct the process of recycling than the materials and energy it saves. One would not recycle a yard of thin copper wire if it cost thousands of dollars and consume massive amounts of energy.<br>
        <LI>Digital objects should also favor sustainable technologies, such as improved recyclability and reusability, as science develops and improves. <br>
        Resource drainage affects the world in a number of ways. These often impede on human rights by exploitation and extraction from countries producing commodities or harvesting raw resources. A number of negative environmental impacts derive from this. As science finds new methods, new sustainable practices, companies should follow and incorporate these to their practices and individual/consumers should favor the companies that do so. <br>

        <LI>People have the right to have access to companies, products, and resources, that not only rely on recycling and reuse as their only sustainability methods and praticies but also utilize other proactive and sustainable methods and practices. <br>
