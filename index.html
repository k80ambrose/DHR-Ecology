      <h1>Declaration on Ecological Human Rights in the Digital Age</h1>

      <h2>Preamble</h2>
        <p>A new form of extraction is emerging, one that reaches into the furthest corners of the biosphere and every nook and cranny inside the human psyche. Capitalism requires an ever-expanding terrain to extract resources from in order to create a surplus. As humans, our relationship with our environment–our ecology–is worth strengthening and protecting. Humans impact the health of ecosystems around the physical world as well as the digital world. As humans we have evolving physical ecology as well as digital ecology. And for a while now, our digital ecology has been eroding the Earth’s ecology.

          <LI><a href='https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22214017/online-shopping-pandemic-packaging-ecommerce-waste-plastic'>Online shopping has become the most popular way to shop due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</a> The packaging is filling landfills and as humans buy new things as perpetually available to them through the digital economy, they also throw old things away that will head to a landfill.

        Ancient cultures in Tibet, Greece, and India referred to earth, air, fire, and water, as the building blocks of everything visible and tangible. These elements, which came to be known as the classical elements, were imbued with cosmological qualities that became archetypes upon which many belief systems were built. Many of these archetypes came to be understood through the elements&rsquo; physical qualities: Fire chemically alters substances it burns. It initiates processes. Water bonds things together and takes the shape of its container. Air does too but in a different way, by expanding like a gas. Earth is solid matter and won&rsquo;t change shape like the two fluid elements.<br><br>
        In this declaration on ecological human rights in the digital age, we adapted the four classical elements to organize four articles of human rights with respect to ecology in the digital age. The elements in this document are used to organize the sections and scaffold the cosmic scope of issues relating to ecology in the task of digitizing human rights.<br><br>

        Earth concerns itself with materiality, solids, and physical byproducts. In the realm of digital infrastructure, data is dirt. In the realm of our global logistics system, earth is the packaging, the planes and trucks that deliver packages, and the carbon they emit.<br><br>
        Air rules communications, intelligence, ideas, social and intangible forces. In the realm of our global logistics systems, air is the actual logistics, the wireless connections linking disparate corners of the globe through supply and demand, the organizational superstructures overseeing international freight shipping and financial markets.<br><br>
        Fire is energy, power, transformation, action, reaction, and processes. In our global logistics system, fire represents energy input and output whether that be fossil fuels or more sustainable sources. Fire is also the agency within each of us to use or not use digital platforms.<br><br>
        Water is life, the way things flow, emotions, and waves. Water in our changing climate relates to declining biodiversity and rising sea levels. In the digital world, water is trends, behavioral patterns, and the flow of data and capital from one party to another. <br><br>

        Technology impacts the world in myriad ways. Technology presents opportunities to innovate, to improve lives, to promote ecological sustainability, and to make the world a better place. But technology also has the potential to exacerbate existing problems as well as create new ones. It can be used to threaten safety, security, privacy, the environment, and even the stability of our democracy.<br><br>
        We hold these truths to be self-evident, that companies, governments, and individuals alike should all take action and recognize that technology has changed absolutely everything, and we cannot act as if it has not,&mdash;That just as technology has transformed the fabric of everyone&rsquo;s lives, we need to transform our worldview to account for these changes, to recognize and address the harms of the digital age, and to harness the opportunities of the digital age for the better,&mdash;That this new digital technology offers tools to help us, but that we cannot see it as a panacea, because it can also be a poison. We have to recognize the role that technology has played in bringing us to this place in history - the unprecedented levels of wealth and standards of living, but also this state of our planet and its impending climate crisis.<br><br>
        Our first primary concern is for preserving and perpetuating the safety, security, and dignity of all people. We want everyone to have the ability to innovate and to pursue economic endeavors. We want them to be able to live lives that are safe, healthy, and dignified. We want their families and their futures to be filled with safety and stability.<br><br>
        <br>
        Our second primary concern is for the planet on which those people live. We envision a world in which the climate crisis is taken seriously and is addressed from every angle. We envision a world in which people are doing whatever they can to protect the environment and to ensure the future of our planet. We envision a world in which the digital space is one in which people collaborate towards a better world, rather than one in which corporations and politicized organizations create more opportunities to hurt people and the planet. <br><br>
        We see infrastructure and the digitization of public services to work towards this future. The world will continue to transform digitally whether we like it or not. We would like this to be intentional in a way that seeks to maintain democracy and human rights as well as equity, equality, inclusion, sustainability, security, safety, health, dignity, and the pursuit of happiness. We want this path to be intentional in terms of the rights of people and their opportunities to work together toward a world that is fair, efficient and sustainable. <br><br>
        <br><br>
        We envision this document as a central reference point that can be referenced by corporations, politicians, organizations, innovators, technologists, engineers, academics, and others with the potential to make lasting change through creating policy or technology that may impact people. Everyone needs to be thinking about their position at this moment in time and how technology is changing the world around them and how their use of technology changes the world and affects others. We know that as students we do not have direct power over any governments, corporations or organizations, but we create this document with the hope that those with the power to change the trajectory of our planet will use these ideas to promote ecological human rights in the digital world and beyond. <br>
        <br><br>
        It is our belief that a better world and a healthy, safe, and sustainable planet is possible, and it is our aspiration that we inspire those in power to recognize the climate crisis and resolve to prioritize the protection of all people and the environment in order to protect fundamental human rights. <br>

                  <LI>A resource calculus will have continual evolving considerations of resources, energy, labor, and many more facets of how digital objects are produced, distributed, and used to determine how useful it is to recycle and reuse a digital object. An exact measure and definition of a resource will not be elaborated fully here but will hopefully be once more people alter this document. <a href='https://www.epa.gov/smm/recycling-economic-information-rei-report'>This</a> is a government report on economic effects of recycling. A resource calculus might deem recycling an unfavorable option if, for example, a material, abundant through ethical means of acquiring, uses more energy to conduct the process of recycling than the materials and energy it saves. One would not recycle a yard of thin copper wire if it cost thousands of dollars and consume massive amounts of energy.<br></OL>

                  <LI>Resource drainage affects the world in a number of ways. These often impede on human rights by exploitation and extraction from countries producing commodities or harvesting raw resources. A number of negative environmental impacts derive from this. As science finds new methods, new sustainable practices, companies should follow and incorporate these to their practices and individual/consumers should favor the companies that do so. <br>
